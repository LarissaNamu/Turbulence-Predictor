# Turbulence-Predictor

TODO
Frontend website - 2 pages
    front page - enter your flight number input box
    second page - dynamic (or static) map displaying the path and the turbulence zones

integrate dynamic map that traces startpoint, endpoint, path, and maps turbulence zones - uhhhhhh
get flight information using AA api
somehow calculate turbulence based on elevation, current weather, and wind sheer (?) for 20-25 mile zones along the path
put turbulence intensity into zones (green = good) (yellow = slight) (orange = bad enough for an announcement) (red = hold on and hope)
